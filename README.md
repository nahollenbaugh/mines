This classic minesweeper game is a project I did to teach myself some android development, from nothing to a thorough enough understanding of the basics to get things running well.  The screenshots folder contains several images of settings menus and gameplay.

Current work includes implementing new features, fixing things I did poorly and outright mistakes I made especially earlier in my learning process, and of course addressing some bugs.
