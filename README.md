This classic minesweeper game is a project I did to teach myself some android development, from ``hmm, Android is Java based, right?'' to a thorough enough understanding of the basics to get things running well.  The screenshots folder contains several images of settings menus and gameplay.

I am currently learning my way through the process of publishing to google play; I will include a link here when I succeed.
